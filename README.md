## Introduction

Now with the lingering impact of demonetization, the enforcement of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), and the lack of trust in property developers in the city, housing units sold across India in 2017 dropped by 7 percent. In fact, the property prices in Bengaluru fell by almost 5 percent in the second half of 2017, said a study published by property consultancy Knight Frank.
For example, for a potential homeowner, over 9,000 apartment projects and flats for sale are available in the range of ₹42-52 lakh, followed by over 7,100 apartments that are in the ₹52-62 lakh budget segment, says a report by property website Makaan. According to the study, there are over 5,000 projects in the ₹15-25 lakh budget segment followed by those in the ₹34-43 lakh budget category.
